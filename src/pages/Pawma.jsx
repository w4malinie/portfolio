            Problem
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1' >
        <p>Available websites for animals rescue organizations are difficult to use, non-intuitive, and have an overwhelming amount of features. Many of them donâ€™t support mobile versions. </p>

            User research
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1' >
        <p>I reached out to several animal rescue organizations and ask them for help with my project. Since people working there are extremely busy 24/7, I decided to send them short surveys instead of conducting typical user interviews. </p> 
        <p>Next, I turned their answers into empathy maps to better understand the target user and their needs. </p>

        <p>The 3 main user pain points were: 
            <ol>
                <li>A regular need for a pet sitting or other type o care for their pets, e.g. for holidays or in emergencies like Covid-19 quarantine. </li><br/>
                <li>Difficulties with finding someone for taking care of their pets because of species or larger number of animals. </li><br/>
                <li>Browsing for the best match through available pet sitters is time-consuming and frustrating.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Next, I sketched out paper wireframes for each page of my website. From several variations I picked one refined design</p> 
        <p>Moving from paper to digital wireframes, I arranged them into user flow for registering a new animal to be sure I design all necessary pages. </p>

                <li>The Multilevel sidebar menu is confusing.</li><br/>

        <p>For an animal lover, it was a pleasure to work on a project for an animal rescue organization. I learned a lot about actual registration forms, the adoption process and more.
        </p>      
        <p>
        I also Iearned that less is more. In this case, it meant reducing the number of features and giving users exactly what they really needed. 
        </p>
        <p>During this project, for the first time, I worked with Adobe XD.
